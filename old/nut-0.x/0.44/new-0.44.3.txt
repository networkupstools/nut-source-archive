What's new in 0.44.3:

Key feature:

 - upsmon callbacks.  upsmon now writes a upsmon.pid file, and you can
   send signals to it.  Use upsmon -c <command> to do it cleanly.

   This is mostly of interest to people looking for a way to shut down
   their systems early, since one of the new commands is FSD - that's
   Forced Shutdown.  Call 'upsmon -c fsd', and your slave upsmon systems
   will run their shutdown techniques before the master system turns off
   the power.

   If you want to shut down after n minutes on power, then use upssched
   to run a timer for that long, then call 'upsmon -c fsd'.  Easy.

   You can also do '-c stop' to tell upsmon to stop itself cleanly.

   Use --with-pidpath to change the default pidpath of /var/run to
   something else.

Other new features:

 - The config parser has been completely reworked.  All configuration files
   should now support goodies like "quoted strings" and \e\s\c\a\p\i\n\g
   characters.  This will have little effect for most users, but it means
   that whitespace is no longer meaningful, so you can spread out your
   configuration directives to look nice and neat.

 - apcsmart: new variables supported: GRACEDELAY, RTHRESH, ALRMDEL.
   [Daniel O'Connor]

 - statedebug now works again, and now supports shared memory drivers.
   This is useful if you are writing a UPS driver, or just hacking on
   the existing code and want to understand how it works.

 - The APC Back-UPS Office with 940-0119A cable is now supported by
   the genericups driver as type 12.		[Peter Ellis]

 - mge-ellipse: New driver for the MGE Pulsar Ellipse.  [Philippe Marzouk]

 - configure will now detect a missing user or group and will warn you
   in case you put something bogus in.  However, if you really want to
   carry on and build with those settings, it won't stop you.
   [Andrew Ryan, Luca Filipozzi]

 - upssched: You can now add another word to CANCEL_TIMER directives
   which is a command to run (via CMDSCRIPT) when the CANCEL_TIMER
   command fails to find an active timer.  This fixes a problem where you
   could send a page for on battery, but not be able to send another
   when it goes back on line.	[Steven Schoch]

 - mgeups: new driver for MGE Pulsar/Comet/Galaxy units.  [Ryan Murray]

 - upseyeux: new driver for MicroDowell BBox models.	[Gilberto Iob]

Bug fixes:

 - upsimage will no longer try to compile if gd wasn't found, so that
   it's obvious that something is missing.  This is mostly a sanity fix
   to hopefully reduce support mails.
 
 - The model drivers now tell you some more useful information about
   their current UID when access to the state file fails.

 - upsd will tell you what's wrong when a shmctl() call fails.

 - nut.spec reworked for RH users.  [Daniel Roesen, others]

 - The compatibility code in the common directory will now only be 
   built on an as-needed basis.  This will stop the problems on some
   systems where the functions were already present in the C library,
   but we built a replacement anyway.	[Ben Collver]

 - "Double opens" in the model drivers are now disabled by default.
   They were breaking NetBSD, and probably aren't needed any more.
   If you find that this version breaks due to this change, then you
   need to reconfigure using --with-double-open and try it again.
   If that works, tell the list about it, since the code will be removed
   if nobody needs it.		[Ben Collver]

 - The bogosity with $(INSTALLROOT) in the man subdirectory is gone.

 - RUNUID and RUNGID now think in terms of user names rather than numbers.
   Trying to resolve them with id and grep was causing portability
   problems.	[Andrew Ryan]

 - upsmon.conf now has better examples to show you how to configure
   the MONITOR directive.	[John M Vinopal]

 - upsd will now stop reading a state file when INFO_MEMBERS isn't
   present.  This will keep it from trying to interpret things that
   aren't state files.	[Peter Ellis]

 - upsd now recognizes instant commands in the form <command>@<host>.
   [Jeff Polk]

 - Warnings about %c vs. %s in newapc format strings fixed.  [Shaul Karl]

 - The apcsmart driver should now do the test for UPSTEMP properly.
   [Karl O. Pinc]

 - nut.spec now has a BuildRequires for gd and includes the man pages.
   [Karl O. Pinc]

 - Local versions of err and errx are provided for systems that lack
   them in the C library.  So far I've only found it on BSD and Linux.

 - The Makefile.in no longer uses := to assign a value for portability.
   [Josh Chattin]

Cleanups:

 This has its own section due to the sheer quantity.

 - rtrim moved to upscommon from drivers
 - rtrim memory leak fixed
 - switched to strlcpy/strlcat (included in common)
 - syslog format string problems fixed
 - more memory leaks fixed
 - const added to function declarations
 - basename moved to common
 - info array is now local to upscommon and isn't exposed to the drivers
   which means they now all use addinfo/setinfo
 - unnecessary strdups dumped
 - switched to err/errx throughout
 - switch_to_user() generic function added
 - more useful functions: vsyslog, upslogx, fatal, fatalx
 - function wrappers: xmalloc, xcalloc, xrealloc, xstrdup
 - setinfo now takes a format string

 There are more.  The full listing can be found in Changes.

What's next:

 - The kludge that is upsset.passwd finally dies, as upsd will learn about
   fine grained user control.

Out there:

 - Possible changes ahead for the driver coding structure.  There's a lot
   of duplication that can be optimized away with a good skeleton design.
