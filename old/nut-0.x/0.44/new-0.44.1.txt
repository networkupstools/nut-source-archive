What's new in 0.44.1:

Key feature:

 - Configurable notify handling for upsmon

   It can be really annoying to have dozens of walls beeping you
   mercilessly when a storm rolls through.  Now you can configure upsmon
   with NOTIFYFLAG so that each NOTIFY event has a series of flags
   associated with it.

   Any combination of syslog, wall and exec (run notifycmd) are supported.
   You can also ignore an event if it suits you.

   The text that upsmon sends via wall and syslog can be set with
   NOTIFYMSG directives in the .conf.  If the stock wording doesn't
   please you, feel free to change it via your config files.  "%s" will be
   replaced with the UPS that's responsible for the current event.

Other new features:

 - The notifycmd script is now called by upsmon with some helpful things
   set in the environment.  UPSNAME and NOTIFYTYPE contain information
   about which UPS generated the event, and what kind of event happened.
   This is far easier than parsing the actual sentences that are sent.

   Note: the text messages are now sent as one big argument.  If you
   are using this feature, be sure to check your scripts so things
   don't break.

 - The powercom driver has more options and features.  [Shaul Karl]

 - The genericups driver now honors TIOCM_ST - generate a BREAK.
   [Peter Astrand]

 - The fentonups and apcsmart drivers now report battery voltage and
   output voltage from compatible hardware. 

 - Serial ports are now opened with O_EXCL to keep ports locked down.

 - The apcsmart driver now supports the 940-0095B grey dual-mode cable.
  
 - Shared memory can now be disabled at compile time with the
   --without-shared-memory switch on configure.  [Jon Nelson]   

 - The optiups driver has been improved and updated.
   [Ted A. Kuban]

 - upsmon can be made to loop after invoking the final shutdown sequence
   so that shutdown scripts will still see it running.  This should
   avoid the [FAILED] that can appear during these conditions.

 - Distributions can now tag the arguments for model drivers onto the 
   UPS lines in the upsd.conf for a unified startup design.
   [Shaul Karl]

 - UID and GID values are no longer hardcoded into the programs at 
   compile-time.  Instead, user and group names are used.  
   [Luca Filipozzi]

 - upsd can bind to a specific interface with -i <IP>.
   [Ondrej Kraus]

New drivers:

 - The bestups driver now recognizes the SOLA 520.  [Nick Allan]

 - powercom: new driver for PowerCom models.  This is like the 
   ups-trust425+625, but is being actively developed and has
   support for the -k shutdown function.  [Shaul Karl]

 - genericups type 11 supports the Powerware 3115 UPS.  [Peter Astrand]

 - belkinups: new driver for Belkin Smart-UPS models.  [Marcus Mueller]

 - engetron: new driver for Engetron Jr models.
   [Adriano Roberto de Lima and Marcio Argollo F. de Menezes]

Bug fixes:

 - The default user on FreeBSD compiles is now uucp, which makes
   more sense considering the usual serial line permissions.

 - The bestups driver should now compile and run on FreeBSD.

 - Calls to uu_lock() should now only happen once.

 - upsmon no longer nukes the syslog socket after going into the
   background, so log messages will again be seen.

 - Access level matching in upsd should now work better in near-overlap
   situations between similar permissions.

 - The extra serial libs for FreeBSD model compiles are back.  They
   were mistakenly deleted during an earlier cleanup of the Makefile.

 - BSD make should again handle the models subdirectory.

 - Note: upscommon's upsreadraw() function no longer includes the 
   trailing CR from the network read.  This only affects people linking
   to this code in their own projects.

 - statedebug, the debugging tool in the server directory, will now
   compile again.  It had been neglected previously.  [Jon Nelson]

 - upsmon should no longer corrupt passwords used for logins.

 - ACCESS lines with passwords in upsd should no longer leak data into 
   following entries.  [Ilia Baldine]

   The config parsing was also completely reworked at the same time to
   make the whole operation cleaner.

What's next:

 - The parade of improvements for upsmon continues, this time for
   initiating things at some offset relative to an event.  If you want
   something to happen n seconds after something else, this is the way.

Out there:

 - upsd will learn about users, and upsset will defer to it.
