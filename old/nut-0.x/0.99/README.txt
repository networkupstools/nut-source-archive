patch-0.99.0 forks from 0.50.1, and includes the same patch that went
into 0.50.1a.

This is now a feature-frozen tree, with the intent of releasing 1.0 soon.
Most of the changes should focus on documentation.  If you are a developer,
take a look at the man pages that cover your code and make sure it still
makes sense.

I'm also no longer doing "-pre" versions, so it will just go .0, .1, etc.
