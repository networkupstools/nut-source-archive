What's new in 0.43.1:

This is mostly a maintenance release for the instant commands.  There's
not a lot of features, but it's better to cut it loose now rather than 
keep everyone waiting another month.

The biggest feature this time:

 - upslog now supports a customizable log format.  Matthew Gabeler-Lee 
   stepped up and added this, so now you can log any variable that's
   supported by your UPS.  You can also put other things in the file
   to spice it up between fields.

Other new stuff:

 - BSD install is now used to put the binaries and config files in place.
   This is a lot better than using mkdir and cp since it'll set the modes
   for us at the same time.  This means the "sensitive" files in the
   CONFPATH are now installed as root, mode 0600.

 - The bestups and fentonups drivers now support the BTEST0 command to
   stop the battery test immediately.

 - The apcsmart driver supports CAL0 and CAL1 - stop and start calibration.
   This is what lets the UPS set the internal "runtime" value.

Bug fixes and cleanups:

 - "Silent failure" Smart-UPS units now have instant commands available.

 - Sending "SET <varname>" with no arguments no longer crashes upsd.  
   You need manager access to do this in conjunction with a raw telnet,
   so it's not "end of the world" material.

 - sscanf is no longer used on data from the network.

 - The configure option for --enable-celsius was previously depreciated.
   It is now gone.  Use TEMPC and TEMPF in your multimon.conf files to
   force one mode or the other.

 - multimon no longer chokes when hosts.conf is missing.

What's next:

 - A few more instant commands for the models

 - Another interface for invoking the commands

Beyond this:

 - upsmon gets more features and a whole lot smarter.
