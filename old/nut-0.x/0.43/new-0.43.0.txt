What's new in 0.43.0:

 - Instant commands.  Some models support interesting new features that let
   you send them a command and see something happen right away.  Right now
   the supported commands are a front panel test and to initiate a battery
   test.  More will follow.

   These are presently supported on the apcsmart, fentonups and bestups
   drivers.  Use the upscmd program to list and invoke instant commands.

 - Some of the cruft in the model programs pertaining to array access has
   been cleaned up.

 - The bestups driver should now report BOOST and TRIM when the input 
   voltage gets into that range and the UPS starts adjusting it.

 - The PowerGuard PG-600 should now be recognized by the fentonups driver.
   It speaks the same protocol as the Fenton models, so that was the 
   natural place to add it.

Bug fixes and the like:

 - upsd now identifies itself when doing the initial "data source for UPS"
   message to the syslog. 

 - The fentonups driver won't advertise LOWXFER and HIGHXFER values when
   it's guessing at the model type based on the string returned.

What's next:

 - More instant commands.

 - A proper manager "console" to integrate variable setting and the
   new instant commands.

Out there:

 - upsmon gets hit with the clue stick and gets a lot smarter.
