What's new in 0.45.1:

Key features:

 - Unified driver configuration begins.  Driver settings can now be
   defined in a new file called ups.conf.  It has a section-based
   format that groups all the details for one UPS together.  This
   replaces the old "UPS" lines in upsd.conf, which are now deprecated,
   and will be removed in a future version.

   A typical configuration might be:

	[su700]
	        driver = apcsmart
        	port = /dev/ttyS1

 - Unified driver control begins.  Using the same ups.conf, you can
   now use the new "upsdrvctl" program to start certain drivers.
   If your drivers support this method, then you can use a standard
   startup sequence for all of your systems:

	/usr/local/ups/bin/upsdrvctl start

   upsdrvctl parses ups.conf and starts the right drivers for you.

   Right now this *only* works for the following drivers:

	- apcsmart
	- belkin
	- bestups 
	- everups
	- fentonups
	- hidups
	- sec

   The other drivers will be converted to support this in future
   releases.  If your driver doesn't support it yet, you can still
   use ups.conf.  You just can't use upsdrvctl to autostart it.

 - Experimental USB UPS support!  This is only working on Linux, and
   then only with kernels that have the hiddev support added.  The
   latest Linus tree (2.4.8) doesn't have it yet, so track down an -ac
   kernel if you want to test this.  See the FAQ for more information
   on how to use the hiddev driver.  This includes patches from Brad
   Hards to run on MGE equipment.

 - upsmon no longer runs most code as root by default.  It now forks,
   with one process retaining root while the other drops it.  The
   root process can do one of two things: shutdown the system or exit.
   The other process does all of the usual UPS monitoring work, and
   sends the shutdown command over a pipe to the root process when
   necessary.

   If you are running scripts from upsmon that depend on root and
   absolutely can't rework them to use the new non-root design, you
   can use the old "single monolithic root process" mode with the 
   -p argument.

   This technique should make it very hard to ever get root through
   upsmon, as the majority of the code now runs as a normal user.
   You can change which user that is with -u <user>.

   This design was inspired by Solar Designer's popa3d.

Other new features:

 - upsimage now rescales the utility voltage graphic intelligently
   when the high and low transfer points are available.  There should
   now be two red sections (top and bottom) surrounding the green center
   area for all users.

 - upsset no longer calls xstrdup with CGI variables without freeing
   the prior value to avoid variable redefinition attacks on system
   resources.  It also has a hard limit on the number of variables
   that can be returned by the client for similar reasons.

 - The serial opening call used by genericups now provides better
   error messages, just like the other drivers have been doing for
   awhile.	[Larry Jones]

 - AEG Protect S. models are now supported by the aeg driver.
   [Ralf Sieger]

 - SMS Ltda (Brazilian) units are now supported with the new
   sms driver.	[Marcio Gomes]

 - For testing purposes, there is now a "dummycons" pseudo-driver.
   This one is like dummyups, but it does not need X.  You can use it
   to test shutdowns and other client issues without torturing your
   actual UPS equipment.

 - The previously hardcoded 15 second delay in upsmon before the
   shutdown command was called is now configurable as FINALDELAY in
   the upsmon.conf.

 - The SOLA 620 is now recognized by the bestups driver.
   [Justin Hawkins]

 - The victronups driver has been updated to report reasonable values
   for LOWXFER and HIGHXFER.  It also now supports several additional
   informational variables on the UPS.	[Michael Hettenbach]

 - The umask is now forced to 022 before writing pid files.  A recent
   issue popped up on some systems that don't set it explicitly,
   leading to such interesting things as a world-writable upsmon.pid
   file.

 - Ever UPS models are now supported by the new everups driver.
   [Bartek Szady]

 - The belkinups driver should now be able to handle the shutdown
   situation where the power returns, and a restart needs to be forced.

 - Common core drivers (see above) now support '-x nolock' to skip the
   usual serial locking procedures.  This is needed on systems like
   FreeBSD that can't lock ports on read-only filesystems, which meant
   that -k shutdowns were basically impossible.

Interface changes:

 - The apcsmart driver has been converted to the new common driver core,
   and that means the hardware-specific arguments have been changed.

   If you used to do this:            You now have to do this:

   apcsmart -c 940-0095B /dev/foo     apcsmart -x cable=940-0095B /dev/foo
   apcsmart -s 2 -k /dev/f00          apcsmart -x sdtype=2 -k /dev/f00

   You can also put those definitions in your ups.conf section for
   this UPS.  See the CHANGES file for the full explanation.

Bug fixes:

 - Battery percentage values outside the usual 0-100% range will no
   longer make upsimage try to generate impossible PNGs.

 - Load percentage values in upsimage are also similarly checked
   for sanity.  Previously, a bogus number from a driver could make it
   burn LOTS of CPU time inside the graphic creation functions.

 - The simple serial port opening routines have had O_NONBLOCK added
   to keep the driver from wedging on some systems that would otherwise
   react badly to certain port status values.	
   [Larry Jones and Alan Eldridge]

 - The genmb build helper script in the model subdirectory is now
   explicitly called with ./ to make sure it gets executed.
   [Shaul Karl]

 - The example in the stock upsd.users now reads INSTCMDS as it should,
   rather than "ALLOW" which was something that leaked out of the
   development phase.	[Alan Eldridge]

 - upsset now says "was ..." rather than "now ..." when changing the
   value of a variable to prevent confusion about what just happened.
   [Bill Richter]

 - The Makefiles now use the included install-sh script to make
   directories, as some of the system-level ones out there don't
   honor the -d switch.

 - String trimming in drivers like fentonups has been fixed.
   Previously, this was causing some otherwise compatible devices with
   spaces in their IDs to be misdetected.

 - A few stray ^Ms have been exterminated from the source files.
   [George Ross]

 - upsd.h no longer blindly includes err.h, which was breaking compiles
   on systems lacking it.	[George Ross]

 - Some changes were made for Unixware 7.1.1 compatibility, including:

   - library dependencies were split into LIBDEP and LIBOBJ

   - sys/termios.h is now included to allow the cfmakeraw compatability
     function to compile.

   [John Hughes]

 - The simple serial open code now sets CLOCAL on the tty to keep the
   system from parsing the modem status lines.	[Larry Jones]

 - INFO_GRACEDELAY now exists in the shared-tables.h, which was causing
   upsd to spit out warnings about unknown variables.	[John Hughes]

 - upsset has had more sanity checks applied to the results of strchr.

 - upssched now sets the umask to 077 before creating the interprocess
   pipe file to keep other people from playing around with it.

 - # comments in config files now work properly, and discard everything
   else on the line.  To use a # in a config file without having it
   be a comment, use a \ to escape it.

 - The genericups.txt document should now accurately reflect the state
   of the driver's UPS types.	[Larry Jones]

 - multimon now uses &deg; instead of a high-bit character for better
   internationalization.	[Henry Nelson]

 - The -k shutdown calls in the common core drivers should work again.

 - The DTR/RTS handling code in the powercom driver has been reworked.

 - upsset now reports errors during the INSTCMD sequence.

 - upsmon no longer checks the number of logins on a slave UPS.  This
   could have caused an interesting temporary lock while two processes
   both watched for the other to depart.  It would have eventually
   exited due to the HOSTSYNC timer, though.

What's next:

 - More control functions for upsdrvctl

 - Better pid file handling

Ongoing:

 - Driver conversions so they can use upsdrvctl

Out there:

 - Make good use of SIGHUP in upsd and upsmon.
