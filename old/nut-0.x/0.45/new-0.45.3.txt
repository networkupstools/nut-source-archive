What's new in 0.45.3:

Key features:

 - upsd can now reload its configuration files on the fly.  You no
   longer have to kill the server and restart it.  upsd will reload
   all config files (ups.conf, upsd.conf, upsd.users) upon receiving
   a HUP signal.  You can also have it signal itself by starting
   another copy with the -c switch, i.e. 'upsd -c reload'.

   Note: if you start upsd as root, reloading may not work.  upsd
   switches to another user if you start it as root, and that user
   may not have permission to read things like the upsd.conf or
   upsd.users files.  If this happens to you, consider making a separate
   role account for upsd.  Also see the FAQ entry on security domains.

Other new features:

 - The newpowercom driver has been added.  This is a new style driver
   from Peter Bieringer that will is intended to replace powercom and
   ups-trust425+625.

 - 'upsdrvctl status' will check for the presence of pid files, so you
   can see if your drivers are still running.  Suggested by Peter
   Bieringer.

 - CyberPower Systems AVR700 units are now partially supported with
   the new experimental cyberpower driver.  This driver should support
   other AVR series models, but some values may look strange.  Users
   with this type of hardware are asked to provide success reports as
   this protocol is not well understood.

   Thanks to the company for providing the AVR700 for development.

 - upsd can be stopped by running it again with '-c stop'.

 - More man pages have been written.

 - The mge-ellipse driver has been upgraded to a version based on the
   new common core for ups.conf support among other things.

Interface changes:

 - configure now uses --with-port instead of --with-udpport, as that
   variable has been controlling both TCP and UDP port numbers for
   a couple of years now.

 - The network protocol has been changed to remap a few error messages
   into the form "ERR <error>" rather than the bogus "ANS <var> <error>".

 - upsd no longer returns empty lists when a UPS is stale.  This 
   means LISTVARS, LISTRW, and LISTINSTCMD will now generate 
   "ERR DATA-STALE" or another error depending on the situation.

Bug fixes:

 - The install targets no longer pollute the prefix with bogus
   cgi-bin and misc directories.

 - The new style drivers no longer chdir to the STATEPATH before the
   shutdown, which is impossible when that filesystem is not mounted.

 - upsmon no longer warns about "not root" when it's supposed to be
   that way.

 - Fixed a bug in upsmon where it could get wedged with a dead file
   descriptor that was returning -EPIPE but never reset the connection.
   This resulted in upsmon losing contact with upsd in the rare event
   that this happened.

 - upsmon now provides information in the syslog when status polls
   or connections to upsd fail.

 - upsd's config handler no longer segfaults when encountering a 
   definition before a section header in the ups.conf. 

What's next:

 - SIGHUP signal handling to make upsmon reload config files

Ongoing:

 - Driver conversion to the common core.  If your favorite driver is
   still using the old style, consider upgrading it yourself.  If you
   do, send me a patch.

Out there:

 - Common control for driver/UPS shutdowns to simplify rc.0 type scripts
