What's new in 0.45.4:

Key features:

 - upsmon can now reload its configuration on the fly.  Just call it
   again with '-c reload' and it will reread upsmon.conf.  You can
   also do this manually by sending a SIGHUP to the process id found in
   upsmon.pid.

   Note: upsmon.conf must be readable by the unprivileged worker
   process that runs the monitoring.  Normally it is only accessible by
   root, so you may have to reconfigure things before this will work on
   your system.  See the documentation for more information.

 - upsdrvctl now has a shutdown command to power off your UPS equipment
   in an orderly fashion.  In the event that you have multiple UPSes
   connected, you can set the shutdown order with "sdorder = n" in the
   ups.conf.  See the man pages for more on this feature.

 - upsd and the drivers can now mmap() the state file to provide a
   better communication channel that doesn't require SysV shared memory.

Other new features:

 - You can now set the user id of the monitoring upsmon process in
   upsmon.conf with the RUN_AS_USER directive.  This is necessary for
   proper operation during reloads (see above).

 - upsmon now warns you if the parent goes away, as a proper OS shutdown
   is no longer possible in that case.  The new notify event is called
   NOPARENT.  This also logs messages to the syslog at the "alert" level
   to make sure this critical condition is seen by the admins.

 - The mustekups driver now supports the Belkin Regulator Pro net
   series.	[Anton Ivanov]

 - New drivers:

   - tripplite - Tripp-Lite SmartUPS models [Rik Faith]
   - newvictron - IMV/Victron hardware [Daniel Prynych]
   - bestferrups801-807 - Best FerrUPS 8.01-8.07 firmware [Jonboy Corbin]
   - genericups type 14 - for Online P-series units [David Santinoli]

 - The dummycons development driver no longer uses pthreads and should
   be usable on more systems as a result.

 - upsdrvctl now waits up to "maxstartdelay" (default 45) seconds for a
   driver to start before it gives up and goes to the next entry.  This
   keeps your system from getting stuck in the startup script if a
   driver decides to misbehave. 

Interface changes:

 - upsmon now forks before calling the NOTIFYCMD.  This means several
   instances of it could be running at the same time if a lot of events
   happen quickly.  If you're doing anything tricky in there, be sure it
   can handle running concurrently with itself.

 - All new-style drivers now disable locking entirely during the
   shutdown (-k) process.   This means users on FreeBSD should no longer
   need kludges like "-x nolock" when powering off the UPS. 

Bug fixes:

 - upsd no longer segfaults when upsd.conf is unavailable during a
   reload.

 - The upsmon privileged parent now ignores most signals.  Previously it
   could react badly to misdirected signals from the user.   

 - upsstats now uses "&deg;" instead of the literal degrees character.

 - Error reporting from upsfetch no longer zaps errno by calling close()
   too early.	[oss-list-ups]

 - Reading and writing to the state files/shared memory is now governed
   by a series of locks to prevent corruption.  Previously it was
   possible for the data to change while upsd was reading from the
   array.	[oss-list-ups]

 - upsd now drops a client if its sendq fills.  This avoids a problem
   where a client could make upsd hang by not accepting data from the
   server.	[oss-list-ups]

 - All new-style drivers now create their state files as
   "driver-port.init" and rename them to the final name once they are 
   finished with the initial process of configuring the info array.
   This keeps upsd from serving up data from an array that is useless.

 - All new style-drivers also now synchronize the child/parent processes
   so the parent does not exit until the child has finished the renaming
   process listed above.  Before this, it was possible for a driver to 
   exit before it was totally ready, and upsd would come along and
   complain about staleness.

 - The fentonups and bestups drivers no longer clobber their callback
   handlers for variable setting and instant commands.	[Rik Faith]   

 - The bestups driver now deals with some models that invert the bypass
   status bit.	[Charles Lepple]

 - upsmon now forks before handling notify events.  This keeps it from
   getting stuck if wall or the NOTIFYCMD take too long.  This also
   fixes a problem where it would come back after DEADTIME, promote the
   UPS to dead, and force a shutdown when things were still OK.

 - upsdrvctl no longer crashes when encountering configuration
   directives above the first UPS section.   

 - newapc no longer leaves a ':' in the RUNTIME variable. [NetBSD]

 - The tree should again compile cleanly on Solaris.
   [Lars Balker Rasmussen]

 - New style drivers no longer fail strangely when specifying -a and
   ups.conf is not available.	[Nigel Metheringham]

 - sete[u|g]id calls are now mapped to setres[u|g]id to fix builds on
   HP-UX 10.20.	[Mark Bergman]

 - A crash in upsd when sending "INSTCMD" with no arguments was fixed.
   [oss-list-ups]

 - Paths linked to the prefix (from configure) now work properly.
   [Phil Davis]

Ongoing:

 - We still need to convert a lot of drivers to the new style.
   If your driver doesn't support ups.conf/upsdrvctl, now is the time
   to get involved.

Out there:

This section is getting harder to do as time goes by.  Here are some
things that will be happening over the next few versions:

 - Named pipe support to allow instant commands and variable setting
   without requiring SysV message queues

 - Returning status from instant commands to clients

 - Fixing upsd.users to not have the bogus "repeat if you need more than
   5" approach, which involves a new open-ended configuration parser
