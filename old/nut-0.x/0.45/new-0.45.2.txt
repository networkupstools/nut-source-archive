What's new in 0.45.2:

Key features:

 - upsdrvctl has more options.  You can now say "stop" to stop all drivers,
   or "stop <ups>" to stop just one.  Also, "start <ups>" to just start
   one is now supported.

 - Lots of man pages.  This isn't a traditional feature, but writing
   documentation isn't a trivial thing, either.

Other new features:

 - ALTPIDPATH.  upsd and the common core model drivers use this path
   to write .pid files.  This defaults to the state path, since those
   programs should not run as root and can't normally write to /var/run.
   Use configure --with-altpidpath to change it.	[Luca Filipozzi]

 - upsd creates a upsd.pid file now so you can kill it cleanly.

 - The common core drivers also now write pid files in the form
   <driver>-<port>.pid.

 - The newapc driver has been converted, so you can now use ups.conf
   and upsdrvctl to control it.  Just like apcsmart, it means a few of
   the command line arguments have changed:

   If you used to do this:          You now have to do this:

   newapc -c 940-0095B /dev/foo     newapc -x cable=940-0095B /dev/foo
   newapc -s 2 -k /dev/f00          newapc -x sdtype=2 -k /dev/f00

   Of course, if you use ups.conf, you can just stick those foo=bar
   values in that section and call it done.  See the docs or the new
   man pages.

 - The new masterguard driver supports Masterguard UPS hardware.
   [Michael Spanier]

 - The fentonups driver now recognizes the PowerCom SMK-800A.
   [Alexander Starostin]

 - The bestups driver now does proper locking on the serial port.
   It now also tries to log helpful messages when the UPS becomes
   unreachable.

 - The sms driver table has been updated, and there is now a sms.txt
   document explaining the cabling.	[Marcio Gomes]

Bug fixes:

 - upsmon no longer tries to create the POWERDOWNFLAG from the
   unprivileged section of the code.  This was preventing systems from
   powering down under certain situations.

 - Various patches to fix builds on Solaris.	[George Ross]

 - configure.in should no longer annoy autoconf 2.52.	[Adam J. Richter]

 - upsset now ignores UPSVAR_* values longer than 256 characters to
   avoid a theoretical memory-related DOS attack.

 - upsmon now calls shutdown() on fds when it exits.

 - upsimage now draws the black utility bar where it should be, instead
   of a couple of pixels too high.	[Jim Sandoz]

 - The apcsmart driver no longer skips the ALRMDEL values due to a
   badly placed break.	[Lars Balker Rasmussen]

 - upssend() no longer returns -1 most of the time due to an extra ;.
   This didn't actually affect any drivers, but it was still wrong. 
   [Lars Balker Rasmussen]

 - A potential memory leak in upsd's ups.conf parser has been squashed.

 - More Solaris/portability fixes (see CHANGES for the full list).
   [Lars Balker Rasmussen]

 - Compiles with shared memory disabled should be cleaner now.
   [Peter Bieringer]

 - The nut.spec now installs more of the man pages.
   [Peter Bieringer]

What's next:

 - SIGHUP signal handling to reload config files in upsd

Ongoing:

 - More driver conversions to the common core (main.c).  Help wanted.

Out there:

 - SIGHUP reloading for upsmon
