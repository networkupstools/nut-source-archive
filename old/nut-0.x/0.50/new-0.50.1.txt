What's new in 0.50.1:

Key features:

 - This version reflects a lot of patch work to clean things up in
   preparation for a final 1.0 release.  The usual "major subsystem
   feature" that would appear here will return after that happens.

Other new features:

 - DESTDIR can now be set during a 'make install' for packaging
   purposes.  The old INSTALLROOT is also still supported for now.

Driver news:

 - The bestuferrups801-807 driver now reports OL instead of nothing when
   not on battery.  It also now terminates the off command with a
   carriage return instead of a newline.	[Doug Rorem]

 - The upseyeux driver has been converted to the new common core and
   is available again.	[Aleksandar Topuzovic]

 - Shutdown problems in mge-utalk have been fixed by removing the 
   confirmation code.	[Arnaud Quette]

 - The sec driver now supports Clary ST-800 hardware and the shutdown
   sequence.	[Eric Lawson]

 - genericups type 17 has been added to monitor PowerKinetics 9001
   equipment.	[Jules Taplin]

 - SOLA 325 hardware is now recognized by the bestups driver.
   [Andrew Dorrell]

 - The bestuferrups driver has been converted to the new style and
   is again part of the normal distribution.	[Andreas Wrede]

 - The powercom driver now handles a "Egys" sub type.  It also now
   uses parameter tables for each of the sub types.	[Simon Rozman]

 - Nitram Elite 2002 models are now supported with genericups type 16.
   [Lyonel Vincent]

 - The fentonups driver now also recognizes PowerCom ULT-1000 hardware.
   [James Bromberger]

 - A new experimental driver for APC SNMP devices called powernet has
   been added.	[Dmitry Frolov]

 - The mge-ellipse driver now reads the manufacturer and model name from
   the UPS.	[Philippe Marzouk]

 - The old powerware driver has been updated, and is back as "bcmxcp".
   [Martin Schroeder]

 - The powercom driver has had some casting cleanups applied.
   [Shaul Karl]

Compatability changes:

 - The drivers are no longer called "models" in the tree.  This was
   becoming a source of confusion, and no longer makes sense given the
   current crop of driver names.

   configure --with-modelpath is now --with-drvpath.

 - The tests for libraries needed by the CGI programs are now only
   performed if you add '--with-cgi' to the configure line.  This will
   make the configure process faster for most users.

   The 'make cgi' target will not work unless you use this new configure
   switch.  configure will also now halt if gd is missing when this is
   set.   

 - The CGI programs no longer default to 'allow' when hosts.conf is
   missing or otherwise unavailable.

Bug fixes:

 - upsd no longer sends access denied messages down the udp socket when
   rejecting TCP connections.

 - A problem in upsd where reconfiguring ups.conf with clients logged
   into the default UPS would confuse the client kicker has been
   corrected.

 - upsmon now recognizes MINSUPPLIES in upsmon.conf again.

 - upsmon and upsd now report on bogus configuration directives to catch
   errors in their respective .conf files.	[Rossz Vamos-Wentworth]   

 - upsd now opens the state file read-only, and doesn't use PROT_WRITE
   for mmap.	[oss-list-ups]

 - 'make install-cgi' now also installs the CGI man pages by default.
   [Shaul Karl]

 - upsd now refers to drivers as drivers rather than the potentially
   confusing wording of "support module".

 - configure --help now lists the default values for the --with and
   --without options at the bottom.	[Shaul Karl]

 - upsd now treats FLAG_RW properly with a bitwise AND.	[Dmitry Frolov]

 - upsct2 now sends the @<upsname> in the SET command when controlling
   a named ups on a server.	[Kurt Wampler]

 - The drivers now call msync on the state file before renaming it to
   the final name.  This fixes a problem on OpenBSD and other
   platforms where the state file contained no useful data.
   [NetBSD - Frederick Bruckman and Martin Husemann, via Luke Mewburn]

 - upslog now honors %% to print a % again.
   [NetBSD - Luke Mewburn]

 - The 'serialize' function has been renamed in the driver core to avoid
   namespace clashes with a library function of the same name on HP/UX.

 - Configuration files that don't end with a newline are now parsed
   properly.	[Bradley W. Langhorst]

What's next:

 - A new tree will open for "correctness" patches - documentation and
   bug fixes.  This will become 1.0, and then interesting new features
   will start being merged again.  It's time to leave the "zero dot"
   world forever.
