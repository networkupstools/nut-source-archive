What's new in 0.42.2:

 - Web variable setting.  If upsct2 isn't your cup of tea, try
   upsset.cgi.  This only gives useful results on APC Smart-UPS and
   Back-UPS Pro models so far, but will also handle other RW-capable 
   models in the future.

   You have to grant the web server system MANAGER access for this to
   work, so check those upsd.conf and upsset.passwd files carefully!

   Previously, upsset.cgi only showed settings and didn't change any.

 - The genericups driver now has a new type for Nitram Elite UPS models.
   Tested and tweaked by Patrick Dupre.

 - The Best Power Fortress Telecom UPS is now recognized by the bestups
   driver.

Fixes and other things in this version:

 - The upsfetch errors are now defined in upsfetch.h with UPSF_ as a
   prefix to avoid namespace clashes in compatible programs.

 - Smart-UPS RM units should now parse the capability strings properly.

 - gd should now link properly when it needs the TrueType or Xpm
   libraries.  Fixed by Bill Carlson.

 - Newer Matrix-UPS models shouldn't complain about the front panel
   language capability entry.  Fixed by Yury Shevchuk.

 - The CGI programs should look a lot better on browsers where the link
   colors need to be explicitly set to be readable.  Previously the 
   programs only set the body and text colors.

 - Best Fortress models with 4 digit VA ratings are now supported.

 - Some compile tweaks were made for IRIX systems.

 - The bestups driver should no longer print dots to infinity when the
   UPS is gone or not responding to the serial port.  It'll give up, which
   is a lot nicer than locking up the system during a boot.

What's next:

 - Development changes gears again to focus on the "manager / instant
   command" idea that's been kicking around for awhile.  This is where
   the fun starts where applicable.  There's nothing quite like setting
   off the front panel chime on a UPS in someone's office when they
   least expect it.  Oh, and it beats playing "find the right UPS" in
   a busy data room.

Beyond that:

 - upsmon will go to see the wizard and get a brain.  Right now it's
   a rather dull sender of walls and mail.  Configurability is the goal
   here.
