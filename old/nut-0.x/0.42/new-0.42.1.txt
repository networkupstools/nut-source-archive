What's new in 0.42.1:

 - Variable setting!  OK, this is only really useful for people with 
   APC Smart-UPS and Back-UPS Pro models right now.  Other models either 
   lack the support in the hardware or documentation on how to work it.

   This requires "MANAGER" access.  Use the upsct2 program's -s argument
   to set a variable to a value you like.  Some variables are enumerated
   types, so you can only set them to certain values.  upsct2 will also 
   show the possible values when called normally (without the -s)...

   The password that upsct2 wants is the same one you put on the ACCESS
   line in upsd.conf for the manager host(s).

 - Lots of FreeBSD fixes.  I finally turned a penguin into a daemon and
   tested it myself.  Things that now work include:

   - uu_lock is now properly detected in configure

   - The model programs now run as group dialer for lockfile happiness

   - gd will now be found, even if it's in /usr/local/lib *and* your
     linker has no clue about it.  configure is smart enough to try adding
     the -I and -L flags that fix the problem for most users.

 - multimon can now "auto-refresh".  Add a ?refresh=nn argument to the URL.

 - Tripp Lite Internet Office contact closure models are now supported by
   the genericups driver as type 5.  Contributed by Stephen Brown.
 
 - Best Patriot contact closure models are now supported by the genericups
   driver as type 6.  Contributed by Brian Craft.

 - CyberPower Power99 is now genericups driver type 7.  

 - Burn those GIFs.  upsimage now uses gdImagePng or nothing.

Fixes and other random things:

 - The battery percentage in the fentonups driver should now be sane.  
   Also, more models should be detected and measured properly now.

 - The C compiler is no longer assumed to be gcc.  It's now whatever
   configure detects, as it should be.

 - The RPM build from the .spec file should now work a lot better during
   the chown.  Fixed by Brian Craft.

 - Older APC "silent failure" models should now be detected properly. 
   Fixed by Matthew Gabeler-Lee.

 - The upscommon tiocmget/set calls have been rearranged so that 
   "special" bits aren't thrown away.  This was inspired by a post to
   linux-kernel about OUT2 being dropped and all sorts of evil following.

 - Matrix-UPS capability strings should now be parsed properly.

What's next:

 - upsset.cgi gets the ability to actually change things.  Right now
   it's still read-only, forcing you to use upsct2 to set a variable.

Still out there:

 - The manager interface incorporating this new variable setting along
   with "instant" commands - run tests, make it beep, and so on.
