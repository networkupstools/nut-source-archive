If you're upgrading from an earlier version, see the UPGRADING file.

What's new since 1.0.0:

 - The CGI programs have received an overhaul.  multimon was replaced by
   an expanded upsstats which can now parse templates.  These templates
   contain directives which tell upsstats how to format the page.  You
   are no longer limited to the hard-coded HTML - your status pages
   can look like anything you want.

   upsimage has a new look, and can generate bars for more variables.
   It also allows you to change the look and feel via the upsstats
   templates, so the color scheme is now up to you.
   [Simon Rozman]

 - Several new drivers:

   - bestfortress: very old Best Fortress equipment
     [Holger Dietze]

   - oneac: Oneac EG and ON hardware
     [Eric Lawson]

   - etapro: ETA UPS hardware with the "PRO" option for smart mode
     [Marek Michalkiewicz]

   - isbmex: SOLA/BASIC Mexico ISBMEX protocol equipment 
     [Edscott Wilson Garcia]

 - Other drivers have received various improvements.

 - The genericups driver now supports an additional type:

  - 18: "TrippLite Omni 450LAN with Martin's cabling" 
        see http://lists.exploits.org/upsdev/Jul2002/00012.htm

 - upsmon now can log in to upsd as a specific user from upsd.users.
   You should switch to this form, as the host-based authentication is
   gradually being removed.  See UPGRADING for more information.
   [Tilman Baumann]

 - upsd and upsmon can now use OpenSSL for encryption and
   authentication.  This is an optional feature, and is not compiled by
   default.  See ssl.txt for more details.

Interface changes:

 - You must now perform 'manager' type commands with user-level
   authentication.  This has been the default for several versions.

   This change should only affect external programs that speak to
   upsd directly.  Just set a USERNAME first, and have a matching entry
   in upsd.users.

 - The upsfetch routines are gone, and have been replaced by upsclient.
   This is a new set of functions that allow stateful connections to
   upsd.  Add-on programs that link to upsfetch will need to be changed
   to handle the new interface.

 - You must now use DESTDIR to send 'make install' into another
   directory.  The old INSTALLROOT is no longer supported.

 - upsct is gone, since upsc now speaks TCP.

 - upsct2 was renamed to upsrw, since it made even less sense with upsct
   gone.

Bug fixes:

 - upsd now logs connect failures at a higher level so they don't escape
   detection with certain syslog configurations.

 - upsd now complains about not being able to read a state file due to
   a change of uid before it goes into the background, so the user can
   see something when it starts.

 - The configuration file parser now reports failures when opening
   files.

 - AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT is now used properly so the configure --help
   displays make sense now.  Some other variable references were fixed
   to incorporate the prefix at the same time.
   [Fridtjof Busse]

 - upsrw (formerly upsct2) now performs more sanity checks on network
   data before using it.

 - upssched no longer exits after executing the first AT line in case
   there are more things that need to be done.
   [Ralph-Thomas Aussem]

 - upssched now does some basic serialization to avoid races when
   starting multiple events.
   [Ralph-Thomas Aussem]

 - Some namespace issues were fixed to clean up compiles on Solaris
   and Tru64 Unix 5.1.
