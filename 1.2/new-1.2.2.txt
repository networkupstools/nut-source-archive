If you're upgrading from an earlier version, see the UPGRADING file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's new since 1.2.1:

 - The snmp-ups driver has been upgraded and expanded.  It now supports
   multiple MIBs, meaning it can handle RFC 1628, APCC, and MGE
   equipment.  You can pick the right one with "mibs=" in ups.conf.

   Support for setting variable and instant commands is also available.
   [Arnaud Quette and Dmitry Frolov]

 - The powernet driver has been upgraded.  It now supports more
   variables, has cleaner logging, and may now be considered stable.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - The hidups driver now supports physical port IDs.  This avoids most
   of the problems where the hiddev* names can jump around too easily.
   It will now stay in the same place as long as you keep it plugged
   into the same physical port.  See the CHANGES file for more details.
   [David Brownell]

 - The hidups driver now also supports the MFR variable on APC
   Back-UPS ES equipment.
   [Jonathan A. Davis]

 - The sms driver has been updated to version 0.70.
   [Marcio Gomes]

 - The bestups driver now recognizes Best Power Axxium Rackmount
   equipment.
   [Ales Casar]

 - The liebert driver now uses O_NONBLOCK, and should now work
   consistently on OpenBSD as a result.
   [Alex Cichowski]

 - The liebert driver also now uses debouncing logic on the status
   lines.  It was possible to get false readings that would start a 
   shutdown or just annoy users with excessive onbatt/online notify
   messages.  The new code forces the status to settle down for 3 polls
   before accepting the new value.

   This means that very short power events may not be detected.  The
   alternative is having your machine shut down just because it decided
   to wiggle over to OB LB for a few seconds.

 - upsmon has had the disconnect logic fixed so the "communications
   lost" (COMMBAD) notify will actually go out when the connection
   fails.
   [Steve Monett]

 - upssched now uses a lock file to prevent a race where two could
   start at the same time.  The second upssched would "win", and the
   first one would be unreachable.  This had the side-effect of not
   being able to cancel timers on the first one.	

   If you use upssched, you must define the LOCKFN directive when
   upgrading to this version, or it will not work.
   [Gaspar Bakos]

 - The packaging and scripts for Red Hat systems have been updated.
   [Antonino Albanese]

 - upsd is now a bit more lenient about access levels in the
   'numlogins' check, which is what caused the problem in upsmon
   (next item).

 - upsmon no longer gets stuck in slavesync() when upsd is configured
   to drop certain queries.  This usually happened at the worst
   possible time: in the middle of a shutdown.
   [John David Garza]

 - The upsclient functions now do more sanity checking on data from
   upsd so a short read won't return garbage to the callers.

 - upsset now works properly with ENUM/VARTYPE values for multiple
   UPSes on a single upsd.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - Various portability fixes for building on SGI were applied.
   [Andrea Suatoni]

 - upsd no longer tries to reference a deleted client structure if the
   client disconnects at the wrong time.  Previously, it tried to use
   that pointer after the sendback() function had already failed on 
   write and deleted the client.  This could cause upsd to segfault
   depending on what areas were accessed.
   [Patrik Schindler]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new since 1.2.0:

 - The sms driver is back, with support for Microlink Manager III
   hardware. [Marcio Gomes]

 - Fideltronik Ares Series hardware is now supported as genericups type
   19.  [Tomek Orzechowski and Arkadiusz Mi¶kiewicz]

 - The drivers no longer silently drop instant commands or set commands
   from upsd that happen to get fragmented in transit.
   [linux@horizon.com]

 - The old multilink driver is back with a new name: liebert.  It
   supports Liebert UPStation GXE hardware with the contact-closure
   cable.  This is currently an experimental driver as there is no
   way to power down the load.   

 - configure now picks up the right flags for gd automatically if gd
   2.0.8 or higher is installed.  This greatly simplifies the CGI build
   process for most users.

 - Shutdowns on FreeBSD using the genericups driver should work again.
   [Petri Riihikallio]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new since 1.0.0:

 - The CGI programs have received an overhaul.  multimon was replaced by
   an expanded upsstats which can now parse templates.  These templates
   contain directives which tell upsstats how to format the page.  You
   are no longer limited to the hard-coded HTML - your status pages
   can look like anything you want.

   upsimage has a new look, and can generate bars for more variables.
   It also allows you to change the look and feel via the upsstats
   templates, so the color scheme is now up to you.
   [Simon Rozman]

 - Several new drivers:

   - bestfortress: very old Best Fortress equipment
     [Holger Dietze]

   - oneac: Oneac EG and ON hardware
     [Eric Lawson]

   - etapro: ETA UPS hardware with the "PRO" option for smart mode
     [Marek Michalkiewicz]

   - isbmex: SOLA/BASIC Mexico ISBMEX protocol equipment 
     [Edscott Wilson Garcia]

 - Other drivers have received various improvements.

 - The genericups driver now supports an additional type:

  - 18: "TrippLite Omni 450LAN with Martin's cabling" 
        see http://lists.exploits.org/upsdev/Jul2002/00012.htm

 - upsmon now can log in to upsd as a specific user from upsd.users.
   You should switch to this form, as the host-based authentication is
   gradually being removed.  See UPGRADING for more information.
   [Tilman Baumann]

 - upsd and upsmon can now use OpenSSL for encryption and
   authentication.  This is an optional feature, and is not compiled by
   default.  See ssl.txt for more details.

Interface changes:

 - You must now perform 'manager' type commands with user-level
   authentication.  This has been the default for several versions.

   This change should only affect external programs that speak to
   upsd directly.  Just set a USERNAME first, and have a matching entry
   in upsd.users.

 - The upsfetch routines are gone, and have been replaced by upsclient.
   This is a new set of functions that allow stateful connections to
   upsd.  Add-on programs that link to upsfetch will need to be changed
   to handle the new interface.

 - You must now use DESTDIR to send 'make install' into another
   directory.  The old INSTALLROOT is no longer supported.

 - upsct is gone, since upsc now speaks TCP.

 - upsct2 was renamed to upsrw, since it made even less sense with upsct
   gone.

Bug fixes:

 - upsd now logs connect failures at a higher level so they don't escape
   detection with certain syslog configurations.

 - upsd now complains about not being able to read a state file due to
   a change of uid before it goes into the background, so the user can
   see something when it starts.

 - The configuration file parser now reports failures when opening
   files.

 - AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT is now used properly so the configure --help
   displays make sense now.  Some other variable references were fixed
   to incorporate the prefix at the same time.
   [Fridtjof Busse]

 - upsrw (formerly upsct2) now performs more sanity checks on network
   data before using it.

 - upssched no longer exits after executing the first AT line in case
   there are more things that need to be done.
   [Ralph-Thomas Aussem]

 - upssched now does some basic serialization to avoid races when
   starting multiple events.
   [Ralph-Thomas Aussem]

 - Some namespace issues were fixed to clean up compiles on Solaris
   and Tru64 Unix 5.1.
   [Petter Reinholdtsen]
