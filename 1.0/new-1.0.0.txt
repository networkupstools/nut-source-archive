What's new since 0.50.0:

The 0.99 tree was a short-lived feature-frozen tree to nail down 1.0.0.
These bugs were fixed during that time:

 - Clients now give a better error message if you try to start an
   unrecognized instant command.	[Len White]

 - configure should recognize more systems thanks to newer versions of
   config.guess and config.sub from automake 1.5.	
   [Arkadiusz Miskiewicz]

 - RH .spec builds now enable the CGI programs at configure-time.
   [Nigel Metheringham]

 - The sample config files no longer get installed into /etc due to a
   missing prefix definition.	["John", Charles Lepple]

 - Comments in the upsmon source were revised to reflect reality.
   [John Horne]

 - The sample upsd.conf no longer points users at access.txt, which was
   been replaced by the upsd.conf(5) man page some time ago.
   [John Horne]

 - upsd no longer crashes if you send it LOGIN without a ups name, then
   log out.  This was also fixed in 0.50.1a due to the severity.

What's next:

 - There will undoubtedly be some kind of "brown paper bag" bug that
   comes along.  Bug fixes and other minor things will continue as
   1.0.x.

 - Meanwhile, 1.1.x will start soon, and it will receive new features
   that have been on hold during this freeze.  My thanks to the other
   developers for their patience during the 0.99 freeze.
